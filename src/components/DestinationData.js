          <h2>Taal Volcano, Batangas</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most iconic views in Luzon, Mt.Taal boasts a volcano
            inside a lake inside an island. If you fancy a closer look, the hike
            up to the crater is a mere 45 minutes, and is easy enough for
            beginners. Guides will assist you most of the way, and you'll see
            the peculiar environment found on an active volcano, including
            volcanic rocks and steam vents. The hike can be dusty and hot, so
            plan for an early morning trip, and then unwind with some bulalo
            before heading back home!

            <h2>Mt. Daguldul, Batangas</h2>
            <p>
              If you're looking for a hike that's a little more challenging but
              still good for a beginner mountaineer, check out Mt. Daguldul in
              San Juan, Batangas. You'll start your hike from the beach and pass
              through tropical forest, different rock formations, and small
              streams. There's a small store halfway up the trail where you can
              take a break and drink buko juice, and though the summit itself
              may not have the best view, the breeze is fantastic. Once you've
              made it back down head straight to the beach for a refreshing,
              well-deserved swim.
